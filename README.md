# My Portfolio Site #
The purpose of this project was to conduct an analysis on the relationship between socioeconomic status and drowning rates in the Midwestern United States using R. 

## Steps to Replicate and Personalize This Site ##
1. Clone this repository to local computer
2. Rename the directory to reflect the new project name
3. Delete .git folder
4. Open PovertyDataScraper.R to scrape the poverty by county information from the PovertyUSA site.
5. Open project_combiningfiles.R to combine drowningrates.csv and poverty.csv and clean it.
6. Open project_data-analysis.R to run statistical tests and create graphs to complete the relationship analysis.

## Potential Adaptations ##
To adapt this project to evaluate more/different states, the state abbreviations in PovertyDataScraper and references to the Midwest would need to be altered.
